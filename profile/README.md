Arc builds infrastructure for agents that learn from operational experience. We automatically capture causality data during execution (what's attempted, how it's corrected, and what results) enabling continual learning without manual annotation or retraining.

This operational supervision is the foundation for training world models that enable agents to simulate, plan, and improve autonomously, creating systems that compound intelligence over time rather than decay from static checkpoints.

Our research-driven approach is open source and validated through peer-reviewed publications. We're building in the open. Explore our work, contribute to research, or reach out to collaborate.
