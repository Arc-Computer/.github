**Arc** is an open-source platform dedicated to enhancing the reliability and efficiency of AI agents. Our tools empower developers to evaluate, debug, and optimize AI agents before they reach production, ensuring robust performance and cost-effectiveness.

## 🔧 Core Projects

### [arc-eval](https://github.com/Arc-Computer/arc-eval)

A developer-first CLI tool designed for:

* **Agent Evaluation**: Assessing agent performance and reliability.
* **Cost Profiling**: Analyzing inference costs to optimize resource usage.
* **Self-Improvement Loops**: Implementing feedback mechanisms for continuous agent enhancement.
* **Agent-as-a-Judge Framework**: Utilizing agents to evaluate and critique other agents.

### [arc-memory](https://github.com/Arc-Computer/arc-memory)

A memory layer for codebases that:

* **Captures Decision Context**: Linking commits, tickets, and design documents to code changes.
* **Predicts Impact**: Highlighting potential areas affected by new code.
* **Supports AI Tools**: Providing context to AI agents for informed code modifications.
