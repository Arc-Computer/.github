## 🚀 About Us

At Arc, we're building the foundational memory layer for modern software engineering. Our mission is simple: ensure engineering teams never lose the critical "why" behind their code.

As AI-driven development accelerates, engineers produce code faster—but without capturing the vital architectural context behind their decisions. This leads to technical debt, fragmented knowledge, and costly inefficiencies.

Arc solves this by embedding a structured, queryable memory directly within the developer's IDE. Our temporal knowledge graph captures architectural decisions, system evolution, and contextual insights in real-time, turning scattered institutional knowledge into actionable intelligence. Instantly access the rationale behind every line of code, streamline your code reviews, and enhance collaboration between human developers and AI-powered agents.

Visit us at [www.arc.computer](www.arc.computer) to learn more and join us as we redefine the future of software development.

> **Mission:** *Bridge the gap between human decisions and machine understanding, becoming the temporal source-of-truth for every engineering team and their agents.*
