## 🚀 Our Vision

Software will soon be written **by fleets of autonomous agents collaborating with humans**.  
That future needs a **shared, trusted memory**—one that captures not just _what_ changed, but **_why every decision was made_**.

Arc builds that memory:

* **Temporal Knowledge Graph, in your IDE** – embeds commit history, PR rationales, issues and ADRs directly in VS Code, so every line knows its past.  
* **Agent-ready API** – any LLM or tool can query the graph (`/searchEntity`, `/traceHistory`, `/openFile`, `/runTests`) to plan safe, multi-step fixes.  
* **Local-first & privacy-first** – graphs are built in CI and stay on the developer’s machine; no code or IP leaves your repo.  
* **Verification layer for AI code** – provenance and test execution ensure AI-generated patches don’t reopen old bugs or violate arch decisions.  
* **Foundation for distributed AI systems** – scalable to monorepos and multi-service graphs, aligning with long-context frontier models.

> **Mission:** *Bridge the gap between human decisions and machine understanding, becoming the temporal source-of-truth for every engineering team and their agents.*

## 🤝 Design Partner Program

We’re onboarding **engineering teams** who:

* Review ≥ 20 pull requests per week  
* Run security-critical or legacy-heavy codebases  
* Want to experiment with AI agents (Cursor, Copilot, etc.)

Design partners get 1-on-1 integration support and influence the roadmap.

## 🛠  Contributing

Arc is open-source _in layers_:

* `arc-memory` (MIT) – core library & CLI 
* `arc-memory-mcp` (MIT) – edge server + tools  
* `arc-extension` (MIT) – VS Code / IDE extension

Bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests are welcome!
