**Arc** is an autonomous platform that enables AI agents to self-improve by learning from production failures. We transform live telemetry data into a continuous remediation loop, making brittle agents resilient through automated detection, synthesis, optimization, and validation.

We believe the future of AI operations is autonomous systems that find, test, and fix failures without human intervention. Every failure should make a system stronger, not an engineer more frustrated.
